# quad-helmholtz

In this project, we studied various quadrature methods (Trapezoidal - Gauss - Hermite) for numerically evaluating an integral. Initially, our focus was on implementing these methods and illustrating their convergence properties. Subsequently, we explored the application of this Python implementation to solve the Helmholtz equation in a homogeneous half-plane. 

## Contents

- **algo.py**: Contains implementations of numerical integration methods such as Trapezoidal, Gauss, and Hermite methods.
- **affichage.py**: Provides functions for displaying results, including plotting 1D and 2D solutions.
- **data.py**: Defines the functions to be integrated and their derivatives.
- **main.py**: Main script to run various experiments, including function interpolation, convergence analysis, and solving the Helmholtz equation.
