# Quadrature Methods: Helmholtz equation 

In this project, we studied various quadrature methods for numerically evaluating an integral. Initially, our focus was on implementing these methods and illustrating their convergence properties. Subsequently, we explored the application of this Python implementation to solve the Helmholtz equation in a homogeneous half-plane.
